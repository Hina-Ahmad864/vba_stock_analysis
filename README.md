Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs ticker, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume
For yearly change we reviewed the opening price at the begining of the year and the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change was from the opening price of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year.
Total stock volume sums the total ticker volume.
From all the tickers, the Greatest % Increase and Decrease are noted.
